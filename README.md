# Bulk-File-Renamer-Python
Dependencies:
  Requires Python and the shutil module

Description:
  The names will be preset as {extensiontyp}-{N}.{extensiontype}
  for example: xyz123.mp4 will be changed to MP4-1.mp4
  The script also creates a log file that contains all changes and the path to the folder
  (the log file is located inside the script's folder)
  I am not responsible for any damage that occures to your files/PC
  Use at your own risk
  This script renames all files within a folder with the extensions: .png .jpg .jpeg 
                                                                     .mp4 .mov .webm . gif
                                                                     
How it works:
  1- You pass a path to the script by copying the address
     of the folder from your windows explorer
  2- The script will process the names and change them
