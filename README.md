# Bulk-File-Renamer-Python
Dependencies: <br />
  Requires Python and the shutil module <br />

Description: <br />
  The names will be preset as {extensiontyp}-{N}.{extensiontype} <br />
  for example: xyz123.mp4 will be changed to MP4-1.mp4 <br />
  <br />
  The script also creates a log file that contains all changes and the path to the folder <br />
  (the log file is located inside the script's folder) <br />
  <br />
  This script renames all files within a folder with the extensions: <br />
  .png .jpg .jpeg .mp4 .mov .webm . gif <br />
  <br />

How it works: <br />
  1- You pass a path to the script by copying the address
     of the folder from your windows explorer <br /> 
  2- The script will process the names and change them <br />
